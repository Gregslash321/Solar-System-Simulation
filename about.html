        <h2 id="mission-title">Our Mission</h2>
        <p id="mission-desc">Cosmic Canvas was created to make the universe accessible and understandable to everyone through an interactive, educational tool. We believe that by providing a platform to explore and create, we can inspire a new generation of astronomers and dreamers.</p>

        <h2 id="tech-title">The Technology</h2>
        <p id="tech-desc">The simulation is built using the HTML5 Canvas API, which allows us to render dynamic, interactive graphics directly in your browser. Our custom JavaScript engine handles all the physics calculations, orbital mechanics, and user interactions, bringing the simulation to life.</p>
        
        <h2 id="scale-title">A Note on Scale</h2>
        <p id="scale-desc">While our simulation strives for accuracy in its principles, please note that the sizes and distances of celestial bodies are not to scale. If they were, the Sun would be a tiny dot, and Earth would be invisible! Our goal is to provide a compelling visual experience that helps you grasp the scale and beauty of the cosmos.</p>
