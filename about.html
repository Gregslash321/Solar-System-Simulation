        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Cosmic Canvas was created to make the universe accessible and understandable to everyone through an interactive, educational tool. We believe that by providing a platform to explore and create, we can inspire a new generation of astronomers and dreamers.</p>

        <h2>The Technology</h2>
        <p>The simulation is built using the **HTML5 Canvas API**, which allows us to render dynamic, interactive graphics directly in your browser. Our custom **JavaScript** engine handles all the physics calculations, orbital mechanics, and user interactions, bringing the simulation to life.</p>
        
        <h2>A Note on Scale</h2>
        <p>While our simulation strives for accuracy in its principles, please note that the sizes and distances of celestial bodies are not to scale. If they were, the Sun would be a tiny dot, and Earth would be invisible! Our goal is to provide a compelling visual experience that helps you grasp the scale and beauty of the cosmos.</p>
